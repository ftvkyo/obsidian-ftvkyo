# obsidian-ftvkyo

This is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin which is tailored specifically for [my](https://github.com/ftvkyo) goals.

For this reason, it is not currently released in the Obsidian plugin store.
For the same reason, feature requests would likely only be implemented if I think "how have I lived without that?"

## Info

See the [documentation](docs/README.md) for:
- Developer docs.
- Future features.
- Extra notes.

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/ftvkyo/obsidian-ftvkyo/wiki) for project features and screenshots.

Note: the plugin is not tested in the Live Editor mode.
