# obsidian-ftvkyo

This is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin which is tailored specifically for [my](https://github.com/ftvkyo) goals.

For this reason, it is not currently released in the Obsidian plugin store.
For the same reason, feature requests would likely only be implemented if I think "how have I lived without that?"
